## Abstract:
The project involves designing a PID controller for a conveyor belt to maintain a constant and stabilized speed, ensuring optimal and safe transportation of elements. The system is intended for transporting 1L bottles with a net weight of 1.108 kg and dimensions of 9 cm x 9 cm x 30 cm. The optimal operating speed is determined based on commercial models, ranging between 9 cm/s and 50 cm/s. The conveyor belt is powered by an AC motor connected to a Siemens frequency inverter, allowing precise speed control. A PWM module and a speed sensor are integrated for constant monitoring and control of the conveyor's rotational speed. The main control variable is the linear speed of the conveyor, maintained constant under varying loads. The primary manipulated variable is the PWM percentage input to the module, which correlates with the frequency output of the inverter.
